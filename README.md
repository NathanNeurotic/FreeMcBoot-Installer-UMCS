# OSDMenu Installer (Not UMCS or FMCB)

This package installs **PS2BBL** and **OSDMenu**, modified/created by @pcm720, the most compatible and latest FMCB release.
A collection of bundled tools and applications have also been included in the installer, so you can jump right in and play.
It is **not** a UMCS or FMCB installer. It is forked from FMCB installer and compatible with UMCS additions.

## Overview

- ‚úÖ Installs **PS2BBL** + **OSDMenu** and a pre-configured environment  
- ‚úÖ Bundled apps that can stay or go after install: Neutrino, NHDDL, OPL, ESR-Launcher, wLaunchELF  
- ‚úÖ Safe to delete everything **except**:
  - `PS2BBL` (**B?EXEC-SYSTEM** folder(s))
  - `BOOT` Folder
  - `SYS-CONF` Folder 
  These are essential for the exploit to function.

# üîÑ Differences from FMCB 1.8 (and other FMCB versions)

- Replaces initialization with external bootloader (PS2BBL)
- Drops ESR and USB support from patcher (can still launch APPS from USB once in OSDMenu)
- Custom OSDSYS replaces FMCB‚Äôs menu with extra details and higher compatibility.
- No button-held ELF launching/LaunchKeys were removed from PS2BBL's Start Up.
- BOOT.ELF still supports launch keys.
- Expands CD/DVD handling:
  - Skip PS2 logo
  - Auto VMC mounts
  - Visual Game ID
  - PS1 disc booting via DKWDRV
- Supports more display modes: `480p`, `1080i`, and line-doubled `240p`
- Fully supports ‚Äúprotokernel‚Äù consoles like SCPH-10000/15000
- Supports launching directly from Memory Card Browser - Yes, you can launch an application by selecting its Save Icon!
- FMCB launcher split into **patcher** and **launcher** due to memory constraints
