# OSDMenu Installer (Not UMCS or FMCB)

This package installs **PS2BBL** and **OSDMenu**, modified/created by @pcm720, the most compatible and latest FMCB release.
A collection of bundled tools and applications have also been included in the installer, so you can jump right in and play.
It is **not** a UMCS or FMCB installer. It is forked from FMCB installer and compatible with UMCS and SAS additions.


## 📦 How To Install

1. **Download and extract** the `.7z` archive to your **FAT32 or exFAT** USB storage device.
2. **Access the USB** from your PS2 using **uLaunchELF**, **wLaunchELF**, or **FDVDB**.
3. **Launch the correct OSDMenu Installer ELF** for your USB format:
   - Use the **FAT32** installer if your USB is formatted as FAT32.
   - Use the **exFAT** installer if your USB is formatted as exFAT.
4. Once inside the installer, **press `R1` twice** to open the **Format MC** menu.
   - 🛑 *This step is strongly recommended and often required.*
   - 💾 *Backup any memory card data you want to keep using wLaunchELF (copy from `mc?:/` to `mass:/`).*
5. When you're ready, **format the Memory Card**.
6. After formatting, **press `L1` twice** to return to the main installer menu.
7. **Select “Install OSDMenu”**.
8. Choose your preferred **PS2BBL coverage type**.
9. Wait for the installer to finish.  
   🕐 *It may take a while — the progress bar might appear stuck, but it’s working. Please be patient.*
10. Once the installation is complete, **reboot your PS2** and enjoy the new setup.


## Overview

- ✅ Installs **PS2BBL** + **OSDMenu** and a pre-configured environment  
- ✅ Bundled apps that can stay or go after install: Neutrino, NHDDL, OPL, ESR-Launcher, wLaunchELF  
- ✅ Safe to delete everything **except**:
  - `PS2BBL` (**B?EXEC-SYSTEM** folder(s))
  - `BOOT` Folder
  - `SYS-CONF` Folder 
  These are essential for the exploit to function.

# 🔄 Differences from FMCB 1.8 (and other FMCB versions)

- Replaces initialization with external bootloader (PS2BBL)
- Drops ESR and USB support from patcher (can still launch APPS from USB once in OSDMenu)
- Custom OSDSYS replaces FMCB’s menu with extra details and higher compatibility.
- No button-held ELF launching/LaunchKeys were removed from PS2BBL's Start Up.
- BOOT.ELF still supports launch keys.
- Expands CD/DVD handling:
  - Skip PS2 logo
  - Auto VMC mounts
  - Visual Game ID
  - PS1 disc booting via DKWDRV
- Supports more display modes: `480p`, `1080i`, and line-doubled `240p`
- Fully supports “protokernel” consoles like SCPH-10000/15000
- Supports launching directly from Memory Card Browser - Yes, you can launch an application by selecting its Save Icon!
- FMCB launcher split into **patcher** and **launcher** due to memory constraints
